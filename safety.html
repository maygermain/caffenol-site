          <h2>Safety</h2>
        </div>

        <div>
          <p>Caffenol has, in part, attracted the attention of many home film developers due to its relative safety.
            Traditional chemicals used in film development often come with hazards; they have to be used in ventilated
            spaces, and should not be ingested or come in contact with the skin.

            In comparison, the use of caffenol in development reduces a number of risks (though it is not entirely
            without).</p>
        </div>

        <div>
          <h3>Coffee</h3>
          <p>Coffee, though acidic, is relatively harmless. The original class at RIT used stainless steel developer
            tanks to avoid coffee stains that could occur on plastic, but this is the extent of the risk.</p>
        </div>

        <div>
          <h3>Washing Soda</h3>
          <p>Washing soda can be irritating to skin and mucous membranes in cases of high expose or inhalation; in cases
            of ingestion, it can cause poisoning. If washing soda comes in contact with the skin or eyes, it should be
            flushed with water immediately. If it is ingested, emergency medical help should be sought.</p>
        </div>

        <div>
          <h3>Vitamin C</h3>
          <p>Vitamin C (ascorbic acid) is often taken for a number of medical reasons, and is generally safe. In
            general, however, avoid ingestion of vitamin C (tablets or powder) used for development, and keep it out of
            your eyes/mucous membranes. Seek medical advice if you are exposed to large amounts.</p>
        </div>

        <div>
          <h3>Fixer</h3>
          <p>Fixer is still required in the caffenol process, and comes with its own set of risks, outlined in the
            material safety data sheets for each individual product. It is important to read these documents, but
            generally speaking, the chemical should be handled in a room with adequate ventilation, while wearing
            protective gear â€“ gloves, goggles and protective clothing. In cases where adequate ventilation is
            unavailable, respiratory protection should be worn.</p>
        </div>

        <div>
          <h3>Fixer Disposal</h3>
          <p>In addition, spent fixer is known to be harmful to aquatic life due to the presence of silver. While some
            individual developers will wash it down the drain with adequate water, local regulations should be taken
            into account; in many places, spent fixer and other photographic chemicals must be disposed of at a
            hazardous waste facility. Read your local legislation to learn more about disposal procedures. </p>
