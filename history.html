          <h2>History</h2>
        </div>

        <div>
          <p>Caffenol developers were first developed by a technical photographic chemistry class at the Rochester
            Institute of Technology in 1995, in an attempt to use household solutions with which to develop film. Armed
            with an understanding of the chemistry underlying the development process, the class experimented with a
            number of items to see what best developed film. </p>
        </div>

        <div>
          <p>The class found that the chemical structure of caffeine granted it similar development capabilities as the
            benzene rings found in organic developers. However, the acidic nature of coffee required that a buffering
            agent be used â€“ the class used baking soda and potassium hydroxide, common household agents, to this
            purpose. This helped to balance the pH of coffee to make it a viable developing agent.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div>
          <p>They used Kodak Tri-X Pan 35mm film, known for contrast control during developing. The recipe used was as
            follows:</p>

          <ul class="ingredient-list">
            <li>2 rounded tsp coffee</li>
            <li>2 rounded tsp baking soda</li>
            <li>Approx. 1 rounded tsp potassium hydroxide (to meet the optimal pH of 9.0)</li>
            <li>12oz water</li>
          </ul>

          <p>This solution was used in development for 25min at a temperature of 85F (almost 30C).</p>
        </div>

        <div>
          <p>Since this experiment, many home developers have experimented with caffenol; the recipes vary based on
            ingredients used and the film stock being developed. Many modern recipes omit baking soda and potassium
            hydroxide in favor of washing soda, and some include vitamin C.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div>
          <p>Beyond this, DIY fixing agents have also been experimented with, with salt water being the most successful;
            however, it is still experimental, and there are mixed reports on its efficacy. Caffenol.org is home to a
            number of recipes (and the source of the recipes listed on this site), and a number of other bloggers post
            about their experiments with caffenol development at home.
